# Guidelines to Contributing

The goal for this repository is to house ideas for a new curriculum here at Jesuit. To that end, I need your feedback and insight. The course will cover three general topics: hardware, software, and cybersecurity.

If you have an idea for a lesson, a topic to teach, an activity to do, a resource to use, or a project to assignment, please create a new file with that idea.

Following the following naming convention for your files: `[ActivityName]_[Category].md`. See the examples below:

  - `BuildingAPC_HARDWARE.md`
  
  - `WritingHelloWorld_SOFTWARE.md`
  
  - `SecurePasswords_CYBERSECURITY.md`

In the actual file, give a brief explanation of your idea.

**Note**: if you are unsure of where your activity fits, use `MISC` as the category.

Feel free to add to the ideas/submissions of others. This is a **collaborative** effort.
